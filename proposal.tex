\begin{abstract}
Computation can be done via measurement only, the outcome of which is dependant on the initial entangled state -- the \textit{cluster state}. This paper will attempt to provide background regarding computation using only measurements, a brief forray into the preparation of cluster states, a discussion of one way quantum computers (1WQC), and the computational power of various configurations of a 1WQC.

\section{Background}
This paper will attempt to discuss some background on cluster states, a correspondence between 1WQC and the more traditional gate array model, and the computational power of this new model.

\subsection{Cluster States}
A cluster state is characterized by a set of eigenvalue equations, which are are determined by the distribution of the qubits on some lattice\cite{briegel2001persistent}.
Briegel and Raussendorf show that any quantum logic circuit can be implemented on a cluster state, which demonstrates universality of the proposed scheme\cite{briegel2000measurements}. Nielsen\cite{nielsen108020universal} extended this result to no longer require coherent dynamics, instead relying on a method to teleport quantum gates, and he provided a concise algorithm to do it. A method to prepare a one-dimensional cluster state is given in \cite{jorrand2005unifying}, consisting of ``cascading'' Controlled-$Z$ ($C_z$) gates on $n$ qubits, where:

\[
C_z = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The action of the $C_z$ gate in the computational basis can be seen to be $\ket{x,y} \to (-1)^{xy}\ket{x,y}$. The set of all single qubit unitaries, coupled with either $C_x$ or $C_z$ has been shown to be universal\cite{brylinski2002universal}.

\subsection{One-Way Quantum Computation}
The unidirectionality of cluster state computation is inherent, due to the fact that the entanglement is progressively consumed at every step. An execution on a one-way quantum computer is a sequence of one-qubit measurements on a cluster state\cite{jorrand2005unifying}.


\subsection{Gate Array Correspondence}
In his analysis of the reducability of 1WQC to the gate array model, Richard Jozsa gives a polynomial time algorithm to perform the conversion between the two computational models\cite{jozsa2006introduction}. 

\subsection{Computational Power and Complexity}
The gate teleportion algorithm\cite{nielsen108020universal} has a time complexity of $O(\log (1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the failure probability. In general, measurement based models can be polynomial time reduced to the gate array model, and thus have the same power, but they are more easily parallelizable\cite{jozsa2006introduction}.
